    "Write a program that reads the contents of a text file. The program should create a dictionary in which the keys are the individual words found in the file and the values are the number of times each word appears. For example, if the word “the” appears 128 times, the dictionary would contain an element with  as the key and 128 as the value. The program should either display the frequency of each word or create a second file containing a list of each word and its frequency."
